## About ##

Privly is a developing set of browser extensions for protecting content wherever it is posted on the internet. This extension allows users to view content on any website, without the host site being able to read the content. For more information on what Privly is, [read about us](https://priv.ly/pages/about).

## Development Status ##

**[Barn Owl](https://github.com/privly/privly-organization/wiki/Barn) Alpha Version**

We are currently fixing bugs and developing the [cryptography library](https://github.com/privly/privly-library/) to package into the extension. For more information about our development path, please see the [central wiki](https://github.com/privly/privly-organization/wiki/Version-List).

The Privly Firefox extension is currently maintained by [Sean McGregor](https://github.com/smcgregor), on behalf of the [Privly Foundation](http://www.privly.org).

## About this Extension ##

This extension currently supports:

* Posting to any website by right-clicking a form element.
* Turning on/off link injection via a button in the "chrome" of the browser.
* All the implemented [Injectable Applications](https://github.com/privly/privly-organization/wiki/Injectable-Applications) of the content server
* Setting the posting content server via extension preferences
* [Active and passive mode](https://github.com/privly/privly-organization/wiki/Link-Operation-Modes) link injection.

## Testing/Submitting Bugs ##

Extension integration test cases are found at [test.privly.org](http://test.privly.org). If you have discovered a bug, only [open a public issue](https://github.com/privly/privly-firefox/issues/new) on GitHub if it could not possibly be a security related bug. If the bug affects the security of the system, please report it privately at [privly.org](http://www.privly.org/content/bug-report). We will then fix the bug and follow a process of responsible disclosure.

You can [install](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privly/) the latest release version of the extension from Mozilla.

You can [install](https://dev.privly.org/PrivlyFirefoxExtension.xpi) the latest development version of the extension (updated automatically every 15 minutes) from the development content server. **NOTE** Installing the extension from this URL will not update your extension in the future. You will have to periodically download new versions. If you are not testing the latest functionality, I would stick with the [Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privly/) link.
